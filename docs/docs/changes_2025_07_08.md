## 🔧 Fixes and Improvements to Cruise Recommendation Engine

### 🐛 Issue 1: `duration_days` not found

**Problem:**  
The code attempted to access `cruise.duration_days`, but this field does not exist in the database.

**Solution:**  
Calculated the duration dynamically:

```python
"duration_days": (cruise.return_date - cruise.departure_date).days
````

**Why this matters:**
No need to store derived values in the database when they can be computed on-the-fly.

---

### 🐛 Issue 2: `n_neighbors > n_samples` in NearestNeighbors

**Problem:**
The model was asked to return more recommendations than the number of cruises available, causing:

```
Expected n_neighbors <= n_samples_fit
```

**Solution:**
Adjusted dynamically:

```python
n_recommendations = min(n_recommendations, len(df))
```

---

### 🐛 Issue 3: `Cruise` not defined

**Problem:**
The `Cruise` model was not imported in `recommendation_engine.py`, leading to a `NameError`.

**Solution:**
Added:

```python
from backend.models.cruise import Cruise
```

---

### ✅ Output Example

```json
[
  {
    "id": 66,
    "title": "Scandinavian Discovery",
    "origin": "Copenhagen",
    "destination": "Helsinki",
    "price": 1450.0
  },
  {
    "id": 67,
    "title": "Scandinavian Discovery",
    "origin": "Copenhagen",
    "destination": "Helsinki",
    "price": 1450.0
  }
]
```

**Explanation:**
The engine returned the most similar cruise options based on:

* Origin port: Copenhagen
* Destination: Helsinki
* Price: Approx. €1450
* Duration: Matched via dynamic calculation

---

### 📌 Summary

* Improved model stability
* Enhanced fault tolerance for small datasets
* Maintained clean separation of model logic and database models
