## 🐛 Fixed: Scheduler crashes during Alembic migration

### Issue:
Running `flask db migrate` or `flask db upgrade` caused the following error:

```

SchedulerAlreadyRunningError

````

### Root Cause:
Alembic’s migration environment (`migrations/env.py`) calls your app’s `create_app()` function,  
which automatically initializes and starts the APScheduler instance.  
Since the scheduler was already running, starting it again raised an exception.

### Solution:
Add an environment check around scheduler initialization in `app.py`:

```python
if os.getenv("FLASK_SKIP_SCHEDULER") != "1":
    scheduler.init_app(app)
    scheduler.start()
````

This allows you to disable the scheduler during migration commands by setting the environment variable:

```bash
FLASK_SKIP_SCHEDULER=1 flask db upgrade
```

### Benefits:

* Separates app runtime from migration tooling environment
* Prevents scheduler from starting multiple times during CLI commands
* Keeps migration smooth and error-free

---

## ✅ Added: `is_active` column to `voyage_legs` table

* Boolean field to mark voyage legs as active/inactive without deletion
* Added via migration ID: `1994cf7c86ef`
