Issue Summary
The update_dummy_user_form function was broken because part of its code was misplaced after another route declaration. This caused:

Validation code to be unreachable.

Flask returning TypeError: The view function did not return a valid response.

Confusing route structure.

Root Cause
The function was split in two: the first part was in the correct place, but the rest (validation + update logic) appeared below show_create_user_form.

A misplaced route decorator and return statement interrupted the function.

Solution
Merged all update_dummy_user_form logic into one complete function.

Ensured no route decorators appear inside another function.

Preserved validations (username required, email regex, max 3 sailing areas).

Ensured every code path returns a valid Flask response (redirect or jsonify).

Impact
✅ Update functionality works reliably.
✅ Routes are now clean and maintainable.
✅ Reduced chance of hidden bugs.

Recommendation
Keep each route self-contained.

Use flask --debug during development to catch similar issues early.

Add unit tests for route behavior.
