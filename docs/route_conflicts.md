Preventing Route Conflicts in Flask Projects
Key Diagnostic Command
bash
Copy
Edit
flask list-routes
or, alternatively, in your app.py add:

python
Copy
Edit
print(app.url_map)
What It Does
Lists all routes currently registered in your Flask app, showing their URLs, HTTP methods, and associated endpoints/functions.

Helps identify duplicate routes that may cause conflicts.

Reveals which Blueprint or handler “owns” each route.

Essential for debugging issues where multiple routes “fight” over the same URL path.

Why This Matters
In Flask, if two different Blueprints or route handlers register the same route (e.g., /), the first one registered typically “wins” and handles all requests for that path. This can cause unexpected behavior, like your intended page not rendering and instead getting a simple string response or an error.

How We Used It
We ran flask list-routes and saw that / was registered both in the main Blueprint and in the user Blueprint.

This explained why the root URL wasn’t rendering the expected template.

We fixed the issue by changing the user Blueprint routes to have a URL prefix (e.g., /users), avoiding any overlap with /.

After the fix, / was managed exclusively by the main Blueprint, and everything worked as expected.

Best Practices to Avoid This Issue
Always assign URL prefixes to Blueprints to namespace their routes and prevent collisions. For example:

python
Copy
Edit
app.register_blueprint(user_blueprint, url_prefix='/users')
Regularly run flask list-routes during development to audit your routing table.

Avoid defining multiple route handlers for the same path, unless explicitly intended with method differences.

Use clear and consistent route naming conventions across your project.

This documentation will save you and your team time and headaches when managing complex Flask projects with multiple Blueprints.
